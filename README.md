# Brainstorm

**Description:** An app ready to help you create your own mind map in an easy way on almost any device.

## Instalation
### Getting the code
**1. Clone the repository**
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/kd226/Brainstorm/
```

**2. Get the sbt in some way**
You can find some information here: [Scala on Android](scala-android.org/).

**3. Open the project and play**
It is open-source so you can look at it, modify and upgrade in any way you need. So have fun.  :bomb:  :balloon:

### Just App
Well, we could send it on Google Play but we they have too much money anyway. So you have to download the .apk file anyway.
